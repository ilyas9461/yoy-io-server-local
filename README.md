# YOYUNCAK SOCKET.IO SERVER LOCAL

## Playground IoT Project

Two things are aimed with this study;
- Sharing some information in the playgrounds by the toys and monitoring computers in the playground,
- Some settings and updates of PC and toys in the playgrounds can be done remotely.

In addition, there is a similar one that works on the server to share over the cloud. It has been designed in this way so that the system can continue to work in case of internet disconnection.

This informations could be:
- The amount of coins available on the contactless card.
- Where and when the contactless card is used.
- Customer information of the contactless card.
